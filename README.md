# PREDICTOOOR

You are looking at the beginnings of my retirement.

This project aims to teach a ML model to read company 10K and 10Q statements in order to predict company performance.

Right now it is all quite a mess, development will be paused while I wait to build a dedicated ML workstation as my macbook air can not handle
the 4 GB of training data in text documents.
